# IoT Dunedin

## What is the Internet of Things?
The Internet of Things is the inter-networking of devices such as smart devices, sensors, software, and other items embedded with electronics.
Connecting these devices to a network creates the Internet of Things and enables the collection and exchange of data between devices and server. 
This data can then be used, accessed and used by an end user. Although very similar, this is not to be confused by wifi. The IoT uses slightly 
different technology to achieve *this*. Our Iot solution is implemented using LoRaWAN.

## What are the applications for IoT?

- Smart Appliances 
- Smart Energy meters

    * The concept of a smart grid, and the smart meters that are used to measure it, predated the Internet of Things.  If we think about       IoT as simply the networking of physical devices to allow them to exchange data, then energy & utilities companies building smart       grids could be considered leaders of the early IoT movement.
    
- Wearable devices

    * Wearable technology is often praised as one of the best applications of IoT. Electronic devices that a consumer can display on           their body have the potential to change the way we live and do things in our everyday life.
    
- Connected cars
- Smart healthcare devices

## What is LoRaWAN 
LoRaWAN is a low-power, long-range, wide area network standard devised by the LoRa Alliance.
It is intended for long-life, battery operated sensor devices to communicate sensed data to a central server via one or more internet-connected gateway devices capable of receiving radio transmissions.

## Our future Goals:
To research and develop an open LoRaWAN consisting of one or more gateway devices, multiple sensor devices, and a central server. All of this in the central Dunedin area, to provide access to user data for use in custom mobile/web/desktop applications.


### Current Status:
Testing prototype working, but not on the right frequencies. 

### Future Plan:
Move prototype to new hardware and onto the right frequencies. (Next semester).
